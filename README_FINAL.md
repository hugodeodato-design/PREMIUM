MRDPS PRO FINAL - ZIP prepared by assistant.

What I added:
- server/ (sync API)
- electron/ (main & preload)
- GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/main.yml
- placeholder package-lock.json files (minimal) to avoid immediate GH Actions failure

Important:
- For production you should replace placeholder package-lock files by ones generated by 'npm install' in a Node environment.
- The workflow will create lockfiles automatically if missing.
- To build locally, run 'npm ci' (root) and in 'frontend' run 'npm ci' then 'npm run build', finally 'npm run build' at root to create installer.
